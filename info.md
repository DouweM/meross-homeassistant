# Meross Custom Component
Based on pure-python library, this custom component enables full control on your meross devices. 

## Features
* Supports the majority of Meross devices on the market: from power plugs to light bulbs to temp/humidity sensors
* Fully async architecture that makes this integration run fast and lightweight 
* Event driven: updates are based on push notification rather than polling when possible 
* Auto discovery of new meross devices
* Autoreconnect in case of connection drop
* Configurable API rate limits

## Requirements
Please note that the Meross devices are controlled via Meross Cloud. This means that homeassistant 
*must have* internet access to accomplish such task. You also need an account for the Meross cloud: 
you can reuse the one from your meross app.

## Configuration
Once installed, the Meross Cloud component needs to be configured in order to work.
You can configure it either via the homeassistant Lovelace web interface: just navigate to 
_settings -> Integrations -> Meross Cloud_. Then type your Meross credentials and you should
be ready to go. 

The following animation shows how to do that.

## Updating from old 0.3.X.X versions
Before updting to version 1.X from older legacy versions, you need to take some steps to ensure everything will work.
1. Remove the Meross component integration
1. Remove all the Meross Devices / Entities (Settings -> Etntities -> _select all meross ones_ -> Delete )
1. Remove all Lovelace cards for old Meross devices 
1. Reboot HA
1. Install latest 1.X Meross integration using HACS or you preferred installation method
1. Set it up as explained in _Configuration_ paragraph
1. Enjoy!

## Be nice!
If you like the component, why don't you support me by buying me a beer or a coffe?
